    "Gauss-Legendre Quadrature is a numerical method to approximate definite integrals developed by Carl Friedrich Gauss. It relies on specially chosen points and weights within the interval of integration to provide highly accurate results. These points are not equispaced but are symmetrically placed with respect to the midpoint of the interval.\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula for Gauss-Legendre Quadrature is expressed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<div style=\"color: green;\">\n",
    "$$ I = \\int_{a}^{b} f(x) \\, dx \\approx \\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i f(x_i) $$\n",
    "</div>\n",

    "#### Weights ($w_i$) and Nodes ($x_i$)\n",
    "- **Weights ($w_i$)**: The weights are coefficients that multiply the function values at the chosen nodes. They are derived from the integral of the Lagrange interpolation polynomials and are selected to maximize the accuracy of the approximation.\n",
    "- **Nodes ($x_i$)**: The nodes are the points at which the function is evaluated. In Gauss-Legendre quadrature, these nodes are the roots of the Legendre polynomials.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Transforming the Integral from $[a, b]$ to $[-1, 1]$\n",
    "To use Gauss-Legendre Quadrature, we often transform the integral from the interval $[a, b]$ to the standard interval $[-1, 1]$. This transformation allows us to use precomputed nodes and weights for the standard interval.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The transformation is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ x = \\frac{b-a}{2}  u + \\frac{a+b}{2} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where u is the variable in the interval $[-1, 1]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using this transformation, the integral becomes:\n",
    "$$ I = \\int_{a}^{b} f(x) \\, dx = \\frac{b-a}{2} \\int_{-1}^{1} f \\left( \\frac{b-a}{2}u + \\frac{a+b}{2} \\right) du $$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the Gauss-Legendre Quadrature approximation can be applied as:\n",
    "$$ I \\approx \\frac{b-a}{2} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i f \\left( \\frac{b-a}{2} u_i + \\frac{a+b}{2} \\right) $$\n",
